In the morning, you might discover that a crow has made breakfast out of your hard work!\nOne way to prevent those bothersome crows from eating your crops is to set up scarecrows near your crops.\nBe aware that scarecrows have limited range, so you'll need multiple if your farm is large.\nScarecrows keep track of how many crows they've diverted.

Mineral yields from other sources require more research.\nDiamonds seem to only form at mine level 50 or greater. At level 50, approximately 1 in 500 stones will be diamond-rich.\n After level 50, the frequency of diamond formation seems to increase by about .000016 per level. Quite a rare gem!\n-M. Jasper",

You are probably more interested in the practical side of brewing...\nTo brew, you will need a keg. I'll leave it up to you to devise blueprints for a keg.\nKegs can be used to make several kinds of product. If vegetables are placed inside, the keg will produce juice. Juice takes the least amount of time to brew.\nIf wheat is placed in the keg, it will produce beer. Beer takes a while to brew, but it is quite profitable.\nPlacing hops in a keg will produce the beloved 'Pale Ale'\nPlace fruit in the keg to make wine. Wine takes the longest of all to make, but a wine made from the finest fruit is worth quite a bit!\nBe patient with your keg... you'll know it's finished when it's perfectly still. And only drink in moderation, or you'll surely regret it!",

Evidence such as this had led me, despite the ridicule of my colleagues, to propose a new theory:\nI believe the dwarves are the remnants of a once advanced civilization whose interplanetary vehicle crashed on this planet long ago.\nI propose that this dwarvish spaceship bore down, deep underground... and over time, the dwarves became adapted to their new underground environment.\n My colleagues ask, 'Why didn't they come above ground and live on the surface?' ...Perhaps their old planet had a thicker atmosphere that protected them from stellar radiation, and they simply could not survive in our sunlight.\n That would explain why they only surface at night to take what they need from our houses...\n\n-M.

It is rumored that he lives in a log submerged in the mountain lake, and only ventures out on rainy spring days to nibble at the frog's eggs. Only the most skilled fisherman can hope to catch this one.\n\nTrain at fishing and be persistent, and eventually you will catch these elusive fish.

Characterized by their green skin, bright red eyes, and foul smell, initial encounters with Goblins can be frightening for unexperienced travelers.^^Despite their unsettling appearance, Goblins possess an intellectual and emotional capacity akin to humans, and have no trouble learning our customs and languages. The goblins I've met have been rather friendly and amiable, once I've shown that I mean no harm. Unfortunately, centuries of distrust and ill-treatment from humans has led many Goblins to pursue careers in the employ of witches, warlocks, necromancers, and other unsavory types.^^A traditional Goblin diet largely consists of grub meat, typically from the large and juicy grub varieties native to the Goblin home-forest. On special occasions, Goblins will indulge in an item called 'void mayonnaise'... considered perhaps the finest delicacy in all Goblin cuisine.",
