Joja Builders have already broken ground for the new JojaMart.^^This must be devastating news for you. So many years in business...a local standby... and now, obscured by the shadow of a powerful, efficient, economically viable corporation. What a shame!^^As manager of the new JojaMart, I feel, to some degree, personally responsible for your predicament. As such, I'd like to offer you a position as Assistant Grocer. Wages start at 5g an hour. I look forward to seeing your resume!^^-Mr. Morris, Manager^Pelican Town JojaMart",
